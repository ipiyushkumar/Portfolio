    <p>
      Back in 2018 i decided to try python, It turned out i had a talent for programming. But i ignored it at the time.
      <br><br>
      In 2020, after completing my 12th stnadard at kendriya vidyalaya, i decided to pursue programming again at the college as B.Tech Graduate.
      <br><br>
      Fast Foreward to today i have had the priviledge of building my career in programming with several languages and tools at my disposal.
      <br><br>
      My Main focus these days is building IT solutions for not so tech savvy professionals that want to get their hands in IT.
      <br><br>
      When i am not on the computer i usually go for bike riding, hanging out with my firends and a cat.
